//## Module
A module is a piece of program that specifies which other pieces it relies on
and which functionality it provides for other modules to use (its interface).




//## Packages
One of the advantages of building a program out of separate pieces, and being
actually able to run those pieces on their own, is that you might be able to
apply the same piece in different programs
